## Features

### Storefront

- Editorial Shopsy homepage with hero cards, collections, metrics, reviews, newsletter CTA, and an Admin Studio preview.
- Product catalog with category filtering, product details, stock labels, and image fallbacks.
- Product cards with add-to-cart, wishlist, increment/decrement controls, direct quantity input, and stock-aware validation.
- Cart with shipping address form, Razorpay checkout, item-level out-of-stock messaging, and safe cart clearing.
- Wishlist page backed by the API.
- Order history and order details with payment status, fulfilment status, shipping address, product image snapshots, and progress.
- Responsive navigation, toast feedback, empty states, loading states, and broken-image placeholders.

### Authentication

- Customer registration and login.
- Cookie-based JWT authentication.
- Password hashing with `bcrypt`.
- Customer and admin roles.
- Protected customer routes and protected admin routes.
- Specific validation messages for invalid name, email, phone, password, duplicate email, and unavailable server errors.

### Admin Studio

- Catalog, customer, order, and paid-revenue overview.
- Product creation, editing, deletion, and stock visibility.
- Low-stock indicators.
- Recent order listing.
- Fulfilment progression: `PLACED` → `CONFIRMED` → `SHIPPED` → `DELIVERED`.

The public homepage and login/signup pages include a small static Admin Studio glimpse. It uses sample values only and never exposes real customer or revenue data.

## Technology stack

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- MongoDB, local or hosted
- Razorpay test account for checkout testing

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Configure the backend

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=5050
dbUrl=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>
jwt_secret=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_test_secret
```

Never commit `.env` files, database credentials, JWT secrets, or Razorpay secrets.

### Start both applications

Option 1:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

Option 2, using two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 2
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The Vite server is configured in [vite.config.js](./frontend/vite.config.js) to use port `5174` during development. The Express API uses port `5050`.

The frontend automatically uses the current browser hostname on port `5050` unless `VITE_API_URL` is set.

## Application pages

The following client-side routes are available after deploying the frontend. Use the deployed frontend domain as the base URL.

| Page | Link | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Login | `/login` | Public |
| Signup | `/signup` | Public |
| Storefront home | `/` | Logged-in customer |
| Products | `/products` | Logged-in customer |
| Product details | `/products/:id` | Logged-in customer |
| Wishlist | `/wishlist` | Logged-in customer |
| Cart and checkout | `/cart` | Logged-in customer |
| Orders | `/orders` | Logged-in customer |
| Order details | `/orders/:id` | Logged-in customer |
| Admin Studio | `/admin` | Admin only |
| Privacy | `/privacy` | Public |
| Terms | `/terms` | Public |
| Shipping and returns | `/shipping-returns` | Public |
| Contact | `/contact` | Public |
| API health | `/health` on the backend domain | Public |

Protected pages redirect to `/login` without a valid authentication cookie.

## Frontend visual references

The application uses a dark green, lime, coral, and editorial cream visual system.

### Authentication

Login and signup use the shared [AuthLeftPanel.jsx](./frontend/src/pages/AuthLeftPanel.jsx), including the Shopsy logo, shopping-bag visual, trust benefits, and an Admin Studio glimpse.

### Storefront imagery

![Shopsy storefront product imagery](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607082349566-187342175e2f?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=85)

Homepage hero and collection cards use curated image URLs. Product records also store an image URL so the same image can appear in catalog cards, cart, wishlist, product details, and order snapshots.

> For production, consider downloading approved images into `frontend/src/assets/` or using a controlled image CDN instead of relying on third-party hotlinks.

## Authentication and roles

### Customer registration

1. Open `/signup`.
2. Enter name, phone, email, and a password of at least seven characters.
3. Submit the form.
4. Log in from `/login`.

The backend normalizes email/name/phone input and enforces unique email addresses. Full names do not need to be unique.

### Admin promotion

An account must exist before it can become an admin:

```bash
cd backend
npm run set-admin -- your-email@example.com
```

Then log out, log in again, and open `/admin`. If the command reports `No customer found`, register that email first.

## Admin dashboard

The Admin Studio frontend is [AdminPage.jsx](./frontend/src/pages/AdminPage.jsx). It loads:

```text
GET /admin/overview
GET /admin/products
GET /admin/orders
PATCH /admin/orders/:id/status
```

All admin endpoints require a valid authentication cookie and a customer record with the `admin` role. The public preview is intentionally static.

## Payment and stock behavior

Checkout uses Razorpay:

1. The frontend submits the shipping address.
2. The backend validates the cart and current stock.
3. The backend creates a local order with `paymentStatus: "PENDING"` and `orderStatus: "PENDING_PAYMENT"`.
4. The backend creates a Razorpay order.
5. Razorpay returns payment details to the frontend.
6. The frontend sends those details to `/orders/verify-payment`.
7. The backend validates the HMAC-SHA256 signature.
8. A MongoDB transaction atomically decrements stock, marks payment `PAID`, changes order status to `PLACED`, stores payment IDs, and clears the cart.

Stock is **not** reduced when an order is only created, pending, cancelled, or failed. Invalid payment signatures also do not reduce stock. If any item lacks stock during successful verification, the transaction rolls back and no item is reduced.

Order names, prices, quantities, and images are snapshotted so historical orders remain consistent if a product later changes.

## Backend API

Base URL: the deployed backend domain configured in `VITE_API_URL`.

### Health

## Environment variables

### Backend `.env`

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `PORT` | No | Express port; defaults to `5050` |
| `dbUrl` | Yes | MongoDB connection string |
| `jwt_secret` or `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | JWT signing secret |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | Checkout | Razorpay key ID |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | Checkout | Razorpay secret used for signature verification |

### Frontend

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.example.com
```

If omitted, the frontend uses the current browser hostname with port `5050`. For production, set `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed backend URL and configure credentials/CORS for the deployed frontend origin.

## Seed products and promote an admin

Seed or update the catalog:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed-products
```

The seeder updates existing records by product name and includes valid images for Graphic Tablet, Pen, Mouse, and Mechanical Keyboard.

Promote an existing customer:

```bash
cd backend
npm run set-admin -- your-email@example.com
```

## Deployment

### Backend

1. Deploy the `backend` directory to a Node.js host.
2. Set `PORT`, `dbUrl`, JWT, and Razorpay variables.
3. Restrict CORS to the deployed frontend origin instead of local origins.
4. Use HTTPS.
5. Run `npm install` and `npm start`.
6. Verify `/health` reports a connected database.

### Frontend

1. Deploy the `frontend` directory to a static host.
2. Set `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.example.com`.
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run build`.
4. Serve `frontend/dist`.
5. Configure SPA fallback so React Router routes serve `index.html`.
6. Test login, logout, cart, Razorpay test payment, order history, and admin access.

### Production security checklist

- Never commit `.env`, credentials, or payment secrets.
- Use a strong random JWT secret and HTTPS.
- Restrict CORS to known frontend origins.
- Use Razorpay production keys only after completing test flows.
- Replace `support@shopsy.example` and other placeholder support/legal details.
- Review privacy, terms, shipping, and returns copy for the real business.
- Replace third-party image hotlinks with owned or licensed assets where possible.
- Back up MongoDB before production migrations or seed operations.

## Validation commands

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run lint

# Backend syntax
node --check backend/server.js
node --check backend/controllers/order.controller.js

# API checks
curl https://your-api-domain.example.com/health
curl https://your-api-domain.example.com/products
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site does not load on port 5174

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open the frontend deployment URL. During development, the Vite configuration binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses port `5174`.

### Frontend loads but API calls fail

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Then open `/health` on the deployed backend domain.

### User is redirected to login

This is expected for protected routes. Log in at `/login`.

### Admin link is missing

```bash
cd backend
npm run set-admin -- your-email@example.com
```

Log out and log in again after promotion.

### Payment does not complete

Check that Razorpay keys exist, the backend is reachable, the cart has sufficient stock, and a Razorpay test checkout is being used. Check the browser console and backend logs for verification errors.
